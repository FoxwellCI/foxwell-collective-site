    <h1>Foxwell Collective Interactive</h1>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is an independent Brazilian indie game studio dedicated to
        the creation of narrative-driven and atmospheric interactive experiences. The studio has
        grown, now featuring a larger team and indirect collaborators supporting its projects.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio operates with a strong focus on creative consistency, long-term vision, and
        meaningful development processes. Our projections indicate that the studio is poised for
        growth, and the current project is progressing steadily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is run by two developers under the age of 18, with all
        public communication, project decisions, and external interactions supervised and
        supported by legal guardians to ensure compliance with applicable laws and platform
        requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to create experiences that feel intentional, cohesive, and emotionally grounded,
        where atmosphere, narrative, and gameplay work together rather than existing as isolated
        elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Studio Structure</h2>

    <p>
        The studio is publicly represented by <strong>Pol</strong>, also known as
        <strong>QuietPollen</strong>, who acts as the Lead Developer and primary coordinator of the
        project. Pol focuses on technical development, narrative structure, gameplay systems design,
        and overall project organization.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to technical responsibilities, Pol also oversees public communication, manages
        official studio accounts, and ensures that all shared information aligns with internal
        guidelines and long-term creative goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second core developer contributes actively to visual design, concept art, and the overall
        aesthetic identity of the project. This includes visual storytelling, mood definition, and
        maintaining artistic consistency across the experience. Due to age-related platform restrictions,
        this developer does not maintain public or official social media accounts and is referred to as
        the internal visual design team.
    </p>

    <p>
        All creative contributions are valid, protected, and recognized internally. Public presence
        is not a requirement for creative impact within the studio.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Current Project</h2>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive is currently developing a narrative-focused project within
        the Mascot Horror genre. The project prioritizes psychological tension, environmental
        storytelling, and emotional immersion rather than explicit or graphic content.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project’s universe, characters, and foundational concepts were developed over a long
        period prior to the studio’s public formation. Many ideas existed in written form long
        before active development began.
    </p>

    <p>
        Development is intentionally paced to allow reflection, iteration, and creative stability.
        The estimated release window is between <strong>2026 and 2027</strong>, ensuring sufficient
        time for polish and consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio is committed to steady growth, continuous improvement, and collaboration with
        both internal and indirect contributors to expand the creative potential of each project.
    </p>

    <h2>Studio Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
        Foxwell Collective Interactive believes that effective horror and tension are created
        through atmosphere, pacing, and emotional consequence rather than shock value alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing, visual design, sound, and gameplay systems are developed together as interconnected
        components of a single experience. No element exists in isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The studio values intentional design decisions, long-term identity, and creative coherence
        over immediate visibility or short-lived trends.
    </p>

    <h2>Curiosities & Background</h2>

    <p>
        The studio’s typography went through multiple redesigns and refinements before reaching its
        current visual identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project existed conceptually long before the studio’s public presence, evolving through
        notes, drafts, and narrative experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The name <strong>QuietPollen</strong> was inspired by another independent developer admired
        by the studio, known publicly as <strong>UniqueGeese</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inspirations include Bendy and the Ink Machine, Poppy Playtime, Indigo Park, Five Nights at
        Freddy’s, and similar narrative-focused interactive works.
